## **Chess JS**

Chess JS is a chess engine written in JavaScript. It works on Min-Max Searching in a tree, Min-Max is a Good Old Fashion Artificial Intelligence (GOFAI) algorithm. The algorithm is a naïve algorithm and for its optimization Alpha-beta pruning is incorporated.

**Alpha-Beta pruning:** This algorithm focuses in reducing the nodes visited in the depth-first search implementation used in the Min-Max Algorithm. Thus, without travelling the entire tree we make basic mathematical conclusions on the tree.

**Rules of Chess:** The Engine follows all rules of Chess specified by **FIDE** ( **Fédération Internationale des Echecs** : International Chess Federation), rules can be referred [here](https://www.fide.com/FIDE/handbook/LawsOfChess.pdf).

**UI and Styling Improvement:** The styling of website till commit-6 (i.e. [commit with heading Day 6](https://github.com/ashishpapanai/chessJS/commit/387ad1f2f922fb39fbaa713d85af4384dcc929cb)) is based of simple HTML and CSS, all UI and UX Improvements made after this commit is based on Open Source Contributions from various communities.
