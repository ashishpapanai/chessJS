            <!--Article 1-->
            <div class="content">
                <h4>The nature and objectives of the game of chess</h4>
                <p>1.1 The game of chess is played between two opponents who move their pieces alternately
                    on a square board called a ‘chessboard’. The player with the white pieces commences the
                    game. A player is said to ‘have the move’, when his opponent’s move has been ‘made’.
                    (See Article 6.7)</p>

                <p>1.2 The objective of each player is to place the opponent’s king ‘under attack’ in such a way
                    that the opponent has no legal move. The player who achieves this goal is said to have
                    ‘checkmated’ the opponent’s king and to have won the game. Leaving one’s own king
                    under attack, exposing one’s own king to attack and also ’capturing’ the opponent’s king
                    are not allowed. The opponent whose king has been checkmated has lost the game.</p>

                <p>1.3 If the position is such that neither player can possibly checkmate, the game is drawn.</p>
            </div>

            <!--Article 2-->
            <div class="content">
                <h4>The initial position of the pieces on the chessboard</h4>
                <p>2.1 The chessboard is composed of an 8 x 8 grid of 64 equal squares alternately light (the
                    ‘white’ squares) and dark (the ‘black’ squares).
                    The chessboard is placed between the players in such a way that the near corner square
                    to the right of the player is white.</p>

                <p>2.2 At the beginning of the game one player has 16 light-coloured pieces (the ‘white’ pieces);
                    the other has 16 dark-coloured pieces (the ‘black’ pieces).</p>

                <p>2.3 The initial position of the pieces on the chessboard is as follows:</p><br>
                <img src="images/initial-position.JPG" alt="">
                <p>2.4 The eight vertical columns of squares are called ‘files’. The eight horizontal rows of
                    squares are called ‘ranks’. A straight line of squares of the same colour, running from one
                    edge of the board to an adjacent edge, is called a ‘diagonal’.</p>
            </div>

            <!--Article 3-->
            <div class="content">
                <h4>The moves of the pieces</h4>
                <p>3.1 It is not permitted to move a piece to a square occupied by a piece of the same colour. If
                    a piece moves to a square occupied by an opponent’s piece the latter is captured and
                    removed from the chessboard as part of the same move. A piece is said to attack an
                    opponent’s piece if the piece could make a capture on that square according to the
                    Articles 3.2 to 3.8. <br>
                    A piece is considered to attack a square, even if such a piece is constrained from moving
                    to that square because it would then leave or place the king of its own colour under
                    attack.</p>

                <p>3.2 The bishop may move to any square along a diagonal on which it stands.</p><br>
                <img src="images/diagnol.JPG" alt="">

                <p>3.3 The rook may move to any square along the file or the rank on which it stands.</p><br>
                <img src="images/rookmovement.JPG" alt="">
                
                <p>3.4 The queen may move to any square along the file, the rank or a diagonal on which it
                    stands.</p><br>
                <img src="images/queenmovement.JPG" alt="">

                <p>3.5 When making these moves the bishop, rook or queen may not move over any intervening
                    pieces.</p>

                <p>3.6 The knight may move to one of the squares nearest to that on which it stands but not on
                    the same rank, file or diagonal.</p><br>
                <img src="images/knightmovement.JPG" alt="">

                <p>3.7 a. The pawn may move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it on
                    the same file, or <br>
                    b. on its first move the pawn may move as in 3.7.a or alternatively it may advance two
                    squares along the same file provided both squares are unoccupied, or <br>
                    c. the pawn may move to a square occupied by an opponent’s piece, which is
                    diagonally in front of it on an adjacent file, capturing that piece. <br>

                    <img src="images/pawnmovement.JPG" alt=""><br>

                    d. A pawn attacking a square crossed by an opponent’s pawn which has advanced two squares in one move from its original square may capture this opponent’s pawn as 
                    though the latter had been moved only one square. This capture is only legal on the move following this advance and is called an ‘en passant’ capture.<br>

                    <img src="images/pawnmovement2.JPG" alt=""><br>

                    e. When a pawn reaches the rank furthest from its starting position it must be
                    exchanged as part of the same move on the same square for a new queen, rook,
                    bishop or knight of the same colour. The player’s choice is not restricted to pieces
                    that have been captured previously. This exchange of a pawn for another piece is
                    called ‘promotion’ and the effect of the new piece is immediate.

                </p>

                <p>3.8 a. There are two different ways of moving the king:
                    by moving to any adjoining square not attacked by one or more of the opponent’s
                    pieces. <br>

                    <img src="images/kingmovement1.JPG" alt=""> <br>

                    or by ‘castling’. This is a move of the king and either rook of the same colour along
                    the player’s first rank, counting as a single move of the king and executed as
                    follows: the king is transferred from its original square two squares towards the
                    rook on its original square, then that rook is transferred to the square the king has
                    just crossed. <br>
                    <div class="special-img"></div>
                    <br>
                    b. (1) The right to castle has been lost: <br>
                        [a] if the king has already moved, or <br>
                        [b] with a rook that has already moved. <br>
                    (2) Castling is prevented temporarily: <br>
                        [a] if the square on which the king stands, or the square which it must
                        cross, or the square which it is to occupy, is attacked by one or more of
                        the opponent's pieces, or <br>
                        [b] if there is any piece between the king and the rook with which castling is
                        to be effected.
                </p>

                <p>3.9 The king is said to be 'in check' if it is attacked by one or more of the opponent's pieces,
                    even if such pieces are constrained from moving to that square because they would then
                    leave or place their own king in check. No piece can be moved that will either expose the
                    king of the same colour to check or leave that king in check.</p>

            </div>

            <!--Article 4-->
            <div class="content">
                <h4>The act of moving the pieces</h4>
                <p>4.1 Each move must be made with one hand only.</p>

                <p>4.2 Provided that he first expresses his intention (for example by saying „j’adoube“ or “I
                    adjust”), the player having the move may adjust one or more pieces on their squares.</p>

                <p>4.3 Except as provided in Article 4.2, if the player having the move deliberately touches on
                    the chessboard: <br>
                    a. one or more of his own pieces, he must move the first piece touched which can be
                    moved <br>
                    b. one or more of his opponent’s pieces, he must capture the first piece touched
                    which can be captured <br>
                    c. one piece of each colour, he must capture the opponent’s piece with his piece or, if
                    this is illegal, move or capture the first piece touched which can be moved or
                    captured. If it is unclear, whether the player’s own piece or his opponent’s was
                    touched first, the player’s own piece shall be considered to have been touched
                    before his opponent’s.</p>
                
                <p>4.4 If a player having the move: <br>
                    a. deliberately touches his king and rook he must castle on that side if it is legal to do
                    so <br>
                    b. deliberately touches a rook and then his king he is not allowed to castle on that side
                    on that move and the situation shall be governed by Article 4.3.a <br>
                    c. intending to castle, touches the king or king and rook at the same time, but castling
                    on that side is illegal, the player must make another legal move with his king (which
                    may include castling on the other side). If the king has no legal move, the player is
                    free to make any legal move. <br>
                    d. promotes a pawn, the choice of the piece is finalised, when the piece has touched
                    the square of promotion.</p>

                <p>4.5 If none of the pieces touched can be moved or captured, the player may make any legal
                    move.</p>

                <p>4.6 When, as a legal move or part of a legal move, a piece has been released on a square, it
                    cannot be moved to another square on this move. The move is then considered to have
                    been made: <br>
                    a. in the case of a capture, when the captured piece has been removed from the
                    chessboard and the player, having placed his own piece on its new square, has
                    released this capturing piece from his hand. <br>
                    b. in the case of castling, when the player's hand has released the rook on the square
                    previously crossed by the king. When the player has released the king from his
                    hand, the move is not yet made, but the player no longer has the right to make any
                    move other than castling on that side, if this is legal.<br>
                    c. in the case of the promotion of a pawn, when the pawn has been removed from the
                    chessboard and the player's hand has released the new piece after placing it on the
                    promotion square. If the player has released from his hand the pawn that has
                    reached the promotion square, the move is not yet made, but the player no longer
                    has the right to play the pawn to another square. <br>
                    The move is called legal when all the relevant requirements of Article 3 have been
                    fulfilled. If the move is not legal, another move shall be made instead as per Article 4.5.
                    </p>   
                
                <p>4.7 A player forfeits his right to a claim against his opponent’s violation of Article 4 once he
                    deliberately touches a piece.</p>

            </div>

            <!--Article 5-->
            <div class="content">
                <h4>The completion of the game</h4>
                <p>5.1 a. The game is won by the player who has checkmated his opponent’s king. This
                    immediately ends the game, provided that the move producing the checkmate
                    position was a legal move. <br>
                    b. The game is won by the player whose opponent declares he resigns. This
                    immediately ends the game.
                    </p>

                <p>5.2 a. The game is drawn when the player to move has no legal move and his king is not in
                    check. The game is said to end in ‘stalemate’. This immediately ends the game,
                    provided that the move producing the stalemate position was legal. <br>
                    b. The game is drawn when a position has arisen in which neither player can
                    checkmate the opponent’s king with any series of legal moves. The game is said to
                    end in a ‘dead position’. This immediately ends the game, provided that the move
                    producing the position was legal. (See Article 9.6) <br>
                    c. The game is drawn upon agreement between the two players during the game. This
                    immediately ends the game. (See Article 9.1) <br>
                    d. The game may be drawn if any identical position is about to appear or has appeared
                    on the chessboard at least three times. (See Article 9.2) <br>
                    e. The game may be drawn if each player has made at least the last 50 consecutive
                    moves without the movement of any pawn and without any capture. (See Article
                    9.3)</p>
            </div>

            <h3 id="subheading">BASIC RULES OF PLAY</h3>

            <!--Article 6-->
            <div class="content">
                <h4>The chess clock</h4>
                <p>6.1 ‘Chess clock’ means a clock with two time displays, connected to each other in such a way
                    that only one of them can run at one time.
                    ‘Clock’ in the Laws of Chess, means one of the two time displays.
                    Each time display has a ‘flag’.
                    ‘Flag fall’ means the expiration of the allotted time for a player.
                    </p>

                <p>6.2 a. When using a chess clock, each player must make a minimum number of moves or
                    all moves in an allotted period of time and/or may be allocated an additional
                    amount of time with each move. All these must be specified in advance. <br>
                    b. The time saved by a player during one period is added to his time available for the
                    next period, except in the ‘time delay’ mode. <br>
                    In the time delay mode both players receive an allotted ‘main thinking time’. Each
                    player also receives a ‘fixed extra time’ with every move. The countdown of the
                    main time only commences after the fixed time has expired. Provided the player
                    stops his clock before the expiration of the fixed time, the main thinking time does
                    not change, irrespective of the proportion of the fixed time used.</p>

                <p>6.3 Immediately after a flag falls, the requirements of article 6.2 a. must be checked.</p>

                <p>6.4 Before the start of the game the arbiter decides where the chess clock is placed.</p>

                <p>6.5 At the time determined for the start of the game the clock of the player who has the
                    white pieces is started.</p>

                <p>6.6 a. Any player who arrives at the chessboard after the start of the session shall lose the
                    game. Thus the default time is 0 minutes. The rules of a competition may specify
                    otherwise. <br>
                    b. If the rules of a competition specify a different default time, the following shall
                    apply. If neither player is present initially, the player who has the white pieces shall
                    lose all the time that elapses until he arrives, unless the rules of the competition
                    specify or the arbiter decides otherwise.</p>

                <p>6.7 a. During the game each player, having made his move on the chessboard, shall stop
                    his own clock and start his opponent’s clock. A player must always be allowed to
                    stop his clock. His move is not considered to have been completed until he has done
                    so, unless the move that was made ends the game. (See the Articles 5.1.a, 5.2.a,
                    5.2.b, 5.2.c and 9.6) <br>
                    The time between making the move on the chessboard and stopping his own clock
                    and starting his opponent‘s clock is regarded as part of the time allotted to the
                    player. <br>
                    b. A player must stop his clock with the same hand as that with which he made his
                    move. It is forbidden for a player to keep his finger on the button or to ‘hover’ over
                    it. <br>
                    c. The players must handle the chess clock properly. It is forbidden to punch it forcibly,
                    to pick it up or to knock it over. Improper clock handling shall be penalised in
                    accordance with Article 13.4. <br>
                    d. If a player is unable to use the clock, an assistant, who must be acceptable to the
                    arbiter, may be provided by the player to perform this operation. His clock shall be
                    adjusted by the arbiter in an equitable way.</p>

                <p>6.8 A flag is considered to have fallen when the arbiter observes the fact or when either
                    player has made a valid claim to that effect.</p>

                <p>6.9 Except where one of the Articles: 5.1.a, 5.1.b, 5.2.a, 5.2.b, 5.2.c applies, if a player does
                    not complete the prescribed number of moves in the allotted time, the game is lost by
                    the player. However, the game is drawn, if the position is such that the opponent cannot
                    checkmate the player’s king by any possible series of legal moves.
                    </p>
                
                <p>6.10 a. Every indication given by the clocks is considered to be conclusive in the absence of
                    any evident defect. A chess clock with an evident defect shall be replaced. The
                    arbiter shall replace the clock and use his best judgment when determining the
                    times to be shown on the replacement chess clocks. <br>
                    b. If during a game it is found that the setting of either or both clocks was incorrect,
                    either player or the arbiter shall stop the clocks immediately. The arbiter shall install
                    the correct setting and adjust the times and move counter. He shall use his best
                    judgement when determining the correct settings.</p>

                <p>6.11 If both flags have fallen and it is impossible to establish which flag fell first then:
                    a. the game shall continue if it happens in any period of the game except the last
                    period. <br>
                    b. the game is drawn if it happens in the period of a game, in which all remaining
                    moves must be completed.</p>
                
                <p>6.12 a. If the game needs to be interrupted, the arbiter shall stop the clocks. <br>
                    b. A player may stop the clocks only in order to seek the arbiter’s assistance, for
                    example when promotion has taken place and the piece required is not available. <br>
                    c. The arbiter shall decide when the game is to be restarted in either case. <br>
                    d. If a player stops the clocks in order to seek the arbiter’s assistance, the arbiter shall
                    determine if the player had any valid reason for doing so. If it is obvious that the
                    player had no valid reason for stopping the clocks, the player shall be penalised
                    according to Article 13.4.</p>
                
                <p>6.13 If an irregularity occurs and/or the pieces have to be restored to a previous position, the
                    arbiter shall use his best judgement to determine the times to be shown on the clocks. He
                    shall also, if necessary, adjust the clock’s move counter.</p>

                <p>6.14 Screens, monitors, or demonstration boards showing the current position on the
                    chessboard, the moves and the number of moves made, and clocks which also show the
                    number of moves, are allowed in the playing hall. However, the player may not make a
                    claim relying solely on information shown in this manner.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <h4> Irregularities</h4>
                <p>7.1 a. If during a game it is found that the initial position of the pieces was incorrect, the
                    game shall be cancelled and a new game played. <br>
                    b. If during a game it is found that the chessboard has been placed contrary to Article
                    2.1, the game continues but the position reached must be transferred to a correctly
                    placed chessboard.
                    </p>

                <p>7.2 If a game has begun with colours reversed then it shall continue, unless the arbiter rules
                    otherwise.</p>
                
                <p>7.3 If a player displaces one or more pieces, he shall re-establish the correct position on his
                    own time. If necessary, either the player or his opponent shall stop the clocks and ask for
                    the arbiter’s assistance. The arbiter may penalise the player who displaced the pieces.</p>

                <p>7.4 a. If during a game it is found that an illegal move, including failing to meet the
                    requirements of the promotion of a pawn or capturing the opponent’s king, has
                    been completed, the position immediately before the irregularity shall be
                    reinstated. If the position immediately before the irregularity cannot be determined
                    the game shall continue from the last identifiable position prior to the irregularity.
                    The clocks shall be adjusted according to Article 6.13. The Articles 4.3 and 4.6 apply
                    to the move replacing the illegal move. The game shall then continue from this reinstated position.
                    <br>
                    
                    b. After the action taken under Article 7.4.a, for the first two illegal moves by a player
                    the arbiter shall give two minutes extra time to his opponent in each instance; for a
                    third illegal move by the same player, the arbiter shall declare the game lost by this
                    player. However, the game is drawn if the position is such that the opponent cannot
                    checkmate the player’s king by any possible series of legal moves.</p>

                <p>7.5 If during a game it is found that pieces have been displaced from their squares, the
                    position before the irregularity shall be re-instated. If the position immediately before the
                    irregularity cannot be determined, the game shall continue from the last identifiable
                    position prior to the irregularity. The clocks shall be adjusted according to Article 6.13.
                    The game shall then continue from this re-instated position.</p>

            <!--Article 8-->
            <div class="content">
                <h4> The recording of the moves</h4>
                <p>8.1 In the course of play each player is required to record his own moves and those of his
                    opponent in the correct manner, move after move, as clearly and legibily as possible, in
                    the algebraic notation (See Appendix C), on the scoresheet prescribed for the
                    competition. <br>
                    It is forbidden to write the moves in advance, unless the player is claiming a draw
                    according to Article 9.2, or 9.3 or adjourning a game according to the Guidelines of
                    Adjourned Games point 1.a. <br>
                    A player may reply to his opponent’s move before recording it, if he so wishes. He must
                    record his previous move before making another. <br>
                    Both players must record the offer of a draw on the scoresheet. (See Appendix C.13)

                    <br>
                    If a player is unable to keep score, an assistant, who must be acceptable to the arbiter,
                    may be provided by the player to write the moves. His clock shall be adjusted by the
                    arbiter in an equitable way.
                    </p>

                <p>8.2 The scoresheet shall be visible to the arbiter throughout the game.</p>
                
                <p>8.3 The scoresheets are the property of the organisers of the event.</p>

                <p>8.4 If a player has less than five minutes left on his clock at some stage in a period and does
                    not have additional time of 30 seconds or more added with each move, then for the
                    remainder of the period he is not obliged to meet the requirements of Article 8.1.
                    Immediately after one flag has fallen the player must update his scoresheet completely
                    before moving a piece on the chessboard.</p>

                <p>8.5 a. If neither player is required to keep score under Article 8.4, the arbiter or an
                    assistant should try to be present and keep score. In this case, immediately after
                    one flag has fallen, the arbiter shall stop the clocks. Then both players shall update
                    their scoresheets, using the arbiter’s or the opponent’s scoresheet. <br>
                    b. If only one player is not required to keep score under Article 8.4, he must, as soon
                    as either flag has fallen, update his scoresheet completely before moving a piece on
                    the chessboard. Provided it is the player’s move, he may use his opponent’s
                    scoresheet, but must return it before making a move. <br>
                    c. If no complete scoresheet is available, the players must reconstruct the game on a
                    second chessboard under the control of the arbiter or an assistant. He shall first
                    record the actual game position, clock times and the number of moves made, if this
                    information is available, before reconstruction takes place.</p>

                <p>8.6 If the scoresheets cannot be brought up to date showing that a player has overstepped
                    the allotted time, the next move made shall be considered as the first of the following
                    time period, unless there is evidence that more moves have been made.
                    </p>

                <p>8.7 At the conclusion of the game both players shall sign both scoresheets, indicating the
                    result of the game. Even if incorrect, this result shall stand, unless the arbiter decides
                    otherwise.</p>
            </div>

            <!--Article 9-->
            <div class="content">
                <h4> The drawn game</h4>
                <p>9.1 a. The rules of a competition may specify that players cannot agree to a draw,
                    whether in less than a specified number of moves or at all, without the consent of
                    the arbiter. <br>
                    b. If the rules of a competition allow a draw agreement the following apply: <br>
                    (1) A player wishing to offer a draw shall do so after having made a move on the
                    chessboard and before stopping his clock and starting the opponent’s clock.
                    An offer at any other time during play is still valid but Article 12.6 must be
                    considered. No conditions can be attached to the offer. In both cases the offer
                    cannot be withdrawn and remains valid until the opponent accepts it, rejects
                    it orally, rejects it by touching a piece with the intention of moving or
                    capturing it, or the game is concluded in some other way. <br>
                    (2) The offer of a draw shall be noted by each player on his scoresheet with a
                    symbol. (See Appendix C.13) <br>
                    (3) A claim of a draw under Article 9.2, 9.3 or 10.2 shall be considered to be an
                    offer of a draw.
                    </p>

                <p>9.2 The game is drawn upon a correct claim by the player having the move, when the same
                    position, for at least the third time (not necessarily by a repetition of moves): <br>
                    a. is about to appear, if he first writes his move on his scoresheet and declares to the
                    arbiter his intention to make this move, or <br>
                    b. has just appeared, and the player claiming the draw has the move.
                    Positions as in (a) and (b) are considered the same, if the same player has the move,
                    pieces of the same kind and colour occupy the same squares, and the possible moves of
                    all the pieces of both players are the same. <br>
                    Positions are not the same if a pawn that could have been captured en passant can no
                    longer be captured in this manner. When a king or a rook is forced to move, it will lose its
                    castling rights, if any, only after it is moved.</p>
                
                <p>9.3 The game is drawn, upon a correct claim by the player having the move, if: <br>
                    a. he writes his move on his scoresheet and declares to the arbiter his intention to
                    make this move, which shall result in the last 50 moves having been made by each
                    player without the movement of any pawn and without any capture, or <br>
                    b. the last 50 consecutive moves have been made by each player without the
                    movement of any pawn and without any capture.</p>

                <p>9.4 If the player touches a piece as in Article 4.3 without having claimed the draw he loses the
                    right to claim, as in Article 9.2 or 9.3, on that move.</p>

                <p>9.5 If a player claims a draw as in Article 9.2 or 9.3 he may stop both clocks. (See Article
                    6.12.b) He is not allowed to withdraw his claim. <br>
                    a. If the claim is found to be correct, the game is immediately drawn. <br>
                    b. If the claim is found to be incorrect, the arbiter shall add three minutes to the
                    opponent’s remaining thinking time. Then the game shall continue. If the claim was
                    based on an intended move, this move must be made as according to Article 4.</p>
                
                <p>9.6 The game is drawn when a position is reached from which a checkmate cannot occur by
                    any possible series of legal moves. This immediately ends the game, provided that the
                    move producing this position was legal.

                <p>10.2 If the player, having the move, has less than two minutes left on his clock, he may claim a
                    draw before his flag falls. He shall summon the arbiter and may stop the clocks. (See
                    Article 6.12.b) <br>
                    a. If the arbiter agrees the opponent is making no effort to win the game by normal
                    means, or that it is not possible to win by normal means, then he shall declare the
                    game drawn. Otherwise he shall postpone his decision or reject the claim. <br>
                    b. If the arbiter postpones his decision, the opponent may be awarded two extra
                    minutes and the game shall continue, if possible in the presence of an arbiter. The
                    arbiter shall declare the final result later in the game or as soon as possible after a
                    flag has fallen. He shall declare the game drawn if he agrees that the final position
                    cannot be won by normal means, or that the opponent was not making sufficient
                    attempts to win by normal means. <br>
                    c. If the arbiter has rejected the claim, the opponent shall be awarded two extra
                    minutes time. <br>

                <h4>The conduct of the players</h4>
                <p>12.1 The players shall take no action that will bring the game of chess into disrepute.</p>

                <p>12.2 Players are not allowed to leave the ‘playing venue’ without permission from the arbiter.
                    The playing venue is defined as the playing area, rest rooms, refreshment area, area set
                    aside for smoking and other places as designated by the arbiter.
                    The player having the move is not allowed to leave the playing area without permission of
                    the arbiter.</p>

                <p>12.3 a. During play the players are forbidden to make use of any notes, sources of
                    information or advice, or analyse on another chessboard. <br>
                    b. Without the permission of the arbiter a player is forbidden to have a mobile phone
                    or other electronic means of communication in the playing venue, unless they are
                    completely switched off. If any such device produces a sound, the player shall lose
                    the game. The opponent shall win. However, if the opponent cannot win the game
                    by any series of legal moves, his score shall be a draw. <br>
                    c. Smoking is permitted only in the section of the venue designated by the arbiter .</p>

                <p>12.4 The scoresheet shall be used only for recording the moves, the times of the clocks, the
                    offers of a draw, and matters relating to a claim and other relevant data.</p>

                <p>12.5 Players who have finished their games shall be considered to be spectators.</p>

                <p>12.6 It is forbidden to distract or annoy the opponent in any manner whatsoever. This includes
                    unreasonable claims, unreasonable offers of a draw or the introduction of a source of
                    noise into the playing area.</p>

                <p>12.7 Infraction of any part of Articles 12.1 to 12.6 shall lead to penalties in accordance with
                    Article 13.4.</p>

                <p>12.8 Persistent refusal by a player to comply with the Laws of Chess shall be penalised by loss
                    of the game. The arbiter shall decide the score of the opponent.</p>

                <p>12.9 If both players are found guilty according to Article 12.8, the game shall be declared lost
                    by both players.</p>

                <p>12.10 In the case of Article 10.2.d or Appendix D a player may not appeal against the decision of
                    the arbiter.
                    Otherwise a player may appeal against any decision of the arbiter, unless the rules of the
                    competition specify otherwise.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <h4>The role of the Arbiter</h4>
                <p>13.1 The arbiter shall see that the Laws of Chess are strictly observed.</p>
                <p>13.2 The arbiter shall act in the best interest of the competition. He should ensure that a good
                    playing environment is maintained and that the players are not disturbed. He shall
                    supervise the progress of the competition.</p>
                <p>13.3 The arbiter shall observe the games, especially when the players are short of time,
                    enforce decisions he has made and impose penalties on players where appropriate.
                    </p>
                <p>13.4 The arbiter can apply one or more of the following penalties: <br>
                    a. warning <br>
                    b. increasing the remaining time of the opponent <br>
                    c. reducing the remaining time of the offending player <br>
                    d. declaring the game to be lost <br>

                    for that game <br>
                    g. expulsion from the event.</p>

                <p>13.5 The arbiter may award either or both players additional time in the event of external
                    disturbance of the game.</p>
                <p>13.6 The arbiter must not intervene in a game except in cases described by the Laws of Chess.
                    He shall not indicate the number of moves made, except in applying Article 8.5, when at
                    least one flag has fallen. The arbiter shall refrain from informing a player that his
                    opponent has completed a move or that the player has not pressed his clock.</p>

                <p>13.7 a. Spectators and players in other games are not to speak about or otherwise interfere
                    in a game. If necessary, the arbiter may expel offenders from the playing venue. If

                    b. Unless authorised by the arbiter, it is forbidden for anybody to use a mobile phone
                    or any kind of communication device in the playing venue and any contiguous area
                    designated by the arbiter.
